# Instructions 
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. One player is known as X's and the other is O's. Players alternate placing their X's and O's on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X's always go first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.

In a One Player Game you play against the computer. You may go first if you select to be X's, otherwise the computer will go first. The Computer is programmed to try to not loose, however this does not mean you can not win.

In a Vs Game you will play against a real human opponet. They may be anywhere in the world and may or may not speak you language however, they are playing you Tic-Tac-Toe.



# browser-template

A template for starting front-end projects. Webpack for `require` system, build
pipeline, and development server. Boostrap and Handlebars.js included. No
front-end frameworks included.

## Installation

1. [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
1. Move to the `wdi/projects` directory, then unzip the template directory with
    `unzip /Users/<user-name>/Downloads/browser-template-master.zip`.
1. Rename the template directory from `browser-template-master` to
    `<project-name>-client`.
1. Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1. Replace all instances of `ga-wdi-boston.browser-template` with the name of
    your project.
1. Move into the new project and `git init`.
1. Add all of the files in your project with the command `git add --all`.
      - **Note: This is the only time you should run this command!**
1. Commit all of your files with the command `git commit`.
      - Your commit title should read `Initial commit`.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Create a new repository on [github.com](https://github.com),
    _not GitHub Enterprise_.
1. Name the new repository with the same name used on Step 3.

## Structure

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

Developers should set `apiUrls.production` and `apiUrls.development` in
[`config/environment.js`](config/environment.js).  With
`apiUrls` set, developers may rely on `apiUrl` as the base for API
URLs.

Developers should store styles in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and load them
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss). Bootstrap version 3 is
included in this template.

Developers should use [getFormFields](get-form-fields.md) to retrieve form data
to send to an API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
- `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard Style
- `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
- `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
- `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
