# Instructions
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. One player is known as X's and the other is O's. Players alternate placing their X's and O's on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X's always go first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.

In a One Player Game you play against the computer. You may go first if you select to be X's, otherwise the computer will go first. The Computer is programmed to try to not loose, however this does not mean you can not win.

In a Vs Game you will play against a real human opponet. They may be anywhere in the world and may or may not speak you language however, they are playing you Tic-Tac-Toe.
